# REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR HOUSE SALES
**Author:** [Daniel Omondi Oselu](https://github.com/danieloselu3)

## OVERVIEW
In this Project, we are doing a Regression Analysis on a Housing dataset obtained from the King County House Sales data.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
**Zillow Inc** has just received a new Branch manager for its NorthWestern Market. The new branch manager is a believer in using data science and analytics to help better customers' experiences, and so he has reached out to our Data Analytics Consultancy firm, **Oselu Data Analytics** to help find a way to help Home owners buy/sell their homes.

After several discussions with the Data Science team, we have decided that we will come up with a way to advice home owners how home renovations can lead to potential increase in the value of their homes.

Our algorithm will be able to help in two fronts:
* **Predictively** - The algorithm should be able to estimate the current value of the house.
* **Inferentially** - We should also be able to provide a formula that can act as a directive on where to make renovations, and by how much, in order to increase the homes' value..

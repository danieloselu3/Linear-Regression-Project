# REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR HOUSE SALES
**Author:** [Daniel Omondi Oselu](https://github.com/danieloselu3)

## OVERVIEW
In this Project, we are doing a Regression Analysis on a Housing dataset obtained from the King County House Sales data.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
**Zillow Inc** has just received a new Branch manager for its NorthWestern Market. The new branch manager is a believer in using data science and analytics to help better customers' experiences, and so he has reached out to our Data Analytics Consultancy firm, **Oselu Data Analytics** to help find a way to help Home owners buy/sell their homes.

After several discussions with the Data Science team, we have decided that we will come up with a way to predict the potential value of their homes using the available dataset.

## DATA
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder.

The Data contains **21597 data points (rows)** of data on the House sales, Containing **21 attributes/Features (columns)** about each house.

## METHODS
Model iterations are developed by methodically improving from prior models, we start by building a base model, which is the model of our target feature with the highest correlated feature.

We then iteratively add more features, while trying to settle on the best model.
